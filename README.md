Two scenarios I used to learn a bit about ruby and cucumber

Using the Cucumber w/Ruby framework complete the following tasks.

    Starting at http://www.realestate.com.au 
    Scenario 1: Build a Test that clicks through the main header links and verifies the landing page matches. i.e. Buy link = realestate.com.au/buy
    Scenario 2: Build a Test that performs a search meeting the following criteria. 1 - State = VIC, Suburb = Richmond, Property Type = Flat, Max Price = 500,000. Verify the listing number results returns and that you actually are searching in this proper State, Suburb.
